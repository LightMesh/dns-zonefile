DNS::Zonefile
=============

The format of a DNS Zonefile is defined in RFC 1035 section 5 and RFC
1034 section 3.6.1. To anyone who's using BIND they'll look very 
familiar.

This is an attempt to use Ruby parse them into an object graph which can 
be investigated programatically, manipulated, validated or printed into 
some canonical form.


Getting setup
-------------

Well, you'll need the treetop and polyglot gems installed. They do all 
the hard work. Thanks!

  sudo gem install treetop polyglot

Now you'll need to generate the Treetop parser from the Zonefile grammar 
that I've hacked together.

  rake generate_grammar

Okay, you're ready to move onto the examples now.


Examples
--------

  zonefile = "/path/to/file.zone"
  zone_string = File.read(zonefile)
  zone = DNS::Zonefile.parse(zone_string)

  puts zone.soa.origin
  puts zone.soa.ns
  puts zone.resource_records[0]
