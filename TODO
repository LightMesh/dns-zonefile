* Allow empty host strings which expand to the zone origin eg:
    [spaces] MX 100 mail4
    -> example.com. MX 100 mail4.example.com.
* Support more record types: http://www.dns.net/dnsrd/rr.html
* Output the zone object-graph as a zone string.
* Should this support sub-types of TXT records - should we recognise 
  SPF records as special TXT records or are these just TXT records?
* Allow comparison of resource records and zones for checking equality.
